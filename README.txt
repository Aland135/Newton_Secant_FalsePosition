This project is a small program which applies different numerical analysis methods: Newton, Secant and False Position.
The formula it is currently being applied to is x*x-2x+1, it is located at the function f.
The formula can be edited inside the f function, but also the f1 function should be edited containing its derivative.
Choose an option from 1 to 3 and then choose the values to get started.
